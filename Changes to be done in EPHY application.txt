Difference between fetch and axios for making http request

Axios

Axios uses the data property.
Axios enjoys built-in XSRF protection.
Axios allows cancelling request and request timeout.
Axios performs automatic transforms of JSON data.
Axios has the ability to intercept HTTP requests.
Axios has wide browser support.
Axios has built-in support for download progress.

Fetch

Fetch is built into most modern browsers; no installation is required as such.
Fetch’s body has to be stringified.
Fetch is a two-step process when handling JSON data- first, to make the actual request; second, to call the .json() method on the response.
Fetch, by default, doesn’t provide a way to intercept requests.
Fetch does not support upload progress.
Fetch only supports Chrome 42+, Firefox 39+, Edge 14+, and Safari 10.1+ (This is known as Backward Compatibility).
